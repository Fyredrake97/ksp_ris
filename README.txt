Race Into Space
===============

"Bill Kerman's Race Into Space" is an asynchronous multiplayer mod for the
 Squad game "Kerbal Space Program".
It allows multiple games to share 'World First' state, awarding extra funds to
 whichever player is first to achieve various milestones.
At least, that's the idea; it's not finished yet.

Race Into Space is currently in alpha; it's had little testing, and the configs
 aren't done.  However, the basic mechanic works.

Race Into Space is developed by Edward Cree, who goes by the handle
 'soundnfury' on IRC and 'ec429' elsewhere.
